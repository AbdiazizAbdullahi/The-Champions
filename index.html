      <h3 class="headers">MANCHESTER CITY CROWNED 2021/22 PREMIER LEAGUE</h3>
      <img class="blog-image" src="/Project/mancity.jpeg">
      <p class="blog-paragraph">For the fourth time in five seasons, Manchester City reigns supreme atop the Premier League table—but it was far from easy.
      Man City won another league title—its second in a row—by overcoming a late two-goal deficit with three goals in five historic minutes to defeat Aston Villa, 3-2, and hold off Liverpool's charge on the final day of the season. It seemed as though City would lose the title after falling behind 2-0 to Villa, but everything changed when İlkay Gündoğan scored in the 76th minute. Two minutes later, Rodri equalized before Gündoğan added his second minutes later that ended up being the title-clincher.
      The result ends Liverpool's quest for what would have been a historic quadruple, with the club already having won the League Cup and FA Cup titles (beating Chelsea in penalty shootouts for both domestic trophies) while also advancing to the Champions League final. It'll play Real Madrid for the European title in Paris on May 28.
      City lost just three times in league play, twice to Tottenham—the first time coming in the first game of the season—and once to Crystal Palace, which also held City to a draw in their other meeting. The club took points off every other team in the league, though and at one point had a 12-match winning streak that ultimately fortified its place atop the table.
